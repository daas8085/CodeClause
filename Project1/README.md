In this code:

  1. Replace C:\\LockedFolder with the actual path of the folder you want to lock.
   2. Set your desired password in the password variable.
   3. The lockFolder method renames the folder by adding "_locked" to the folder name, effectively locking it.
   4. The unlockFolder method reverses the process by renaming the locked folder back to its original name.
