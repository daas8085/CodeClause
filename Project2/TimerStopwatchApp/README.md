  1. This code creates a simple Timer and Stopwatch application with a graphical user interface (GUI) using Java Swing. 
     The application includes a timer that counts up from 00:00:00 when the "Start" button is pressed and stops when the "Stop" button is pressed. 
     The "Reset" button resets the timer to 00:00:00. The elapsed time is displayed in HH:MM:SS format.
