#Project1
In this code:

   1. Replace C:\\LockedFolder with the actual path of the folder you want to lock.
   2. Set your desired password in the password variable.
   3. The lockFolder method renames the folder by adding "_locked" to the folder name, effectively locking it.
   4. The unlockFolder method reverses the process by renaming the locked folder back to its original name.


#Project2

    1. This code creates a simple Timer and Stopwatch application with a graphical user interface (GUI) using Java Swing. The application includes a timer that counts up from           00:00:00 when the "Start" button is pressed and stops when the "Stop" button is pressed. The "Reset" button resets the timer to 00:00:00. The elapsed time is displayed in        HH:MM:SS format.
